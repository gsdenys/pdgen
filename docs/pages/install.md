# Install

Until now, this software does not have installers, so the user can download it, unzip it and place the executable file in the installation location. For some cases adding an environment variable is recommended.

This software is builded to __Mac__ (_amd64_ and _arm64_), __Linux__ (_i386_, _amd64_, and _arm64_), and __Windows__ (_i386_ and _amd64_). All installations files and checksum are disponible at [Download Release Page](https://github.com/gsdenys/pdgen/releases/latest)
